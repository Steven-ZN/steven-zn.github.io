**Computer Science @ Kean University** (Expected May 2026)  
Research in Weakly Supervised Segmentation, Active Learning, and LLMs.  
Dean's Honor List • 3.91 GPA (2024-2025)

## About Me

I am a Computer Science undergraduate at **Kean University** (expected May 2026) with a strong focus on machine learning and medical imaging research. Achieved a 3.91 GPA during the 2024-2025 academic year and recognized on the Dean's Honor List.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **computer vision**, **weakly supervised learning**, and **healthcare AI applications**. I'm particularly passionate about developing efficient learning algorithms that can work with limited labeled data - a critical challenge in medical imaging.
